# Extra Credit - Reproducibility evaluation – Due December 19th, 2021 (20 points)

You will run the notebook submitted by another group (which we will assign to you) and
produce a reproducibility report that describes what you did to re-run the experiment. For example, were all dependencies declared? Were you able to run the notebook as is? Did you have to install new packages? Were you able to get the same results?

You should also provide feedback on the techniques used and on potential improvements.

Your report will be embedded in the original notebook and will be shared with all students in the class. 

You should submit the notebook file on Brightspace unde “Final Project: Extra credit”. The notebook should include
The name of the group performing the evaluation and the names/nyuids of the group members
The name of the group being evaluated and a link to their github repo
Your reproducibility report and feedback
