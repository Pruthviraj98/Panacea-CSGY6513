# Assignment-3

A dataset will be assigned to each group. The 3 project members will collaboratively explore the assigned dataset to identify data quality issues.
 
You should follow the best practices discussed in the Data Cleaning lectures, and apply the techniques you learned as well as other techniques available in the literature and in open-source tools. You will:
1)	Profile the data: you will explore and learn about the data
2)	Look for different types of data quality issues, including incorrect values (e.g., typos – brklyn), inconsistency between values (e.g., zipcodes or city names), missing data, outliers
3)	Clean the data and create a new version of the dataset. Discuss your cleaning decisions, in particular when it was not clear what the right approach should be.
 
You can use existing tools, e.g., 
Datamart Geo (https://pypi.org/project/datamart-geo)
Datamart Profiler (https://pypi.org/project/datamart-profiler, https://docs.auctus.vida-nyu.org/python/datamart-profiler.html)
OpenClean (https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/openclean)
and you can also implement your own methods.


Deliverable: You will submit a reproducible and documented Jupyter or Zepellin notebook that shows the different steps you followed. 
Here’s a an example of a reproducible and well-documented notebook: https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/openclean/blob/master/examples/notebooks/Parking%20Violations%20-%20Profiling%20and%20Cleaning%20Example.ipynb

This will count as your Homework Assignment 3.
